# Notes

- Start with a brute-force, pure, na√Øve approach - to avoid pre-optimisation.
  - Separated concerns:
    - Fluid particles (vortons)
      - Direct summation first.
    - Rendering tracers.
      - General renderer setup and lifecycle.
      - Tracer particles:
        - GPGPU ping-pong buffers drawn in line segment pairs of current/past positions (after Lumens).
    - Spatial partitions, and derived calculations/lookups/interpolations.
      - Grids, textures.
      - More to be investigated below.
- Optimisations, improvements, and considerations:
  - Spatial partitions, alternatives to the `uniform grid`:
    - [Excellent collision overview, streaming segment trees, and benchmark comparisons](https://0fps.net/2015/01/23/collision-detection-part-3-benchmarks/)
    - Important for both speed and accuracy; the articles initially avoid delving into spatial partition approaches, then go on to fundamentally rely on them and compensate for sampling errors arising from them.
    - Could this be a simpler case of tracking nearest neighbours (maybe weighted by distance, such as with SPH)? An interpolation could be made this way; the vorton neighbours are the sample points for which the fluid properties are known.
    - Does the mesh/spatial partition have to be of uniform cell size to work for interpolations/tree-code...?
      - KD-tree cells aren't square-ish; octree cells are. Does uniformity affect the fidelity of the fluid sim operations (interpolation, "supervortons", etc)?
      - KD-tree traversal involves lots of ascending/descending the hierarchy(?); octrees are more regular and predicatble(?).
      - Reducing jerkiness and improving sampling accuracy is helped by particles and the spatial partition to be aligned (see Particle-In-Cell method?)... best to use KD-tree there?
    - BVH / R-tree
      - How would interpolation work? Simply sum/integrate of nearest volumes, divided by their distance (similar to the supervorton abstraction or SPH kernels)?
  - Filaments instead of points?

- Ideas
  - Cloud flying dream: fly a character around and through clouds of various forms (lighting, forces, storms, cumulonimbus and others, hurricanes, lightning, feeding by evaporation, etc), with the character able to collide with the clouds and vice versa (surf, tumble through, skirt, shape, etc), and controlled in a nicely fluid way (hand/pose tracking as areodynamic wings, drag along spline, etc)... Inspiration ([A Year Along the Geostationary Orbit](https://vimeo.com/342333493), clouds in Phonsovan)
  - Life barrage: model of a person's head, dragging on the window produces a jet (of e.g: ionised glowing air) blasting the face (from offscreen at angles inwards about a hemisphere), which collides with the face (exerting forces like a hairdryer flapping mouth), gradually blasting off particles of material (which flow away) to expose some underlying flesh/bone, regrowing as an aged form of the face... when oldest, all becomes dust... and then the cycle repeats with an inner head (e.g: Russian dolls).
  - Cascading objects: objects (heads, Saigon motorbike traffic, etc) cascading in a turbulent flow, to give a sense of crowded copiousness... (how are the objects oriented?).
  - Shape-shifting character: combine vsicous fluid dynamics with springs and rigged animation, for a shape-shifting character that sneaks and stretches around environments.
